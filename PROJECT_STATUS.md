## Quality Standards Established

### Five Required Enhancements

Every chapter must include:

1. **Core Lie Exposure**
   - The fundamental deception the platform relies on
   - Explained early in chapter
   - Anchors all subsequent analysis

2. **International Comparison**
   - How other countries regulate (or don't)
   - What works, what doesn't, why
   - What could be done but isn't

3. **Concrete Data Anchors**
   - Named studies with institutions and years
   - Specific statistics, not vague claims
   - Real cases, documented scandals
   - Multiple sources per chapter

4. **Parent Self-Audit**
   - 10 uncomfortable questions
   - Reveals visibility gaps
   - Non-judgmental but direct

5. **Technical Depth & Alternatives**
   - How the platform actually works
   - Three-tier interventions (Start/Next/Nuclear)
   - Ranked alternatives with specifics
   - Device-level controls with exact settings

### Consistency Requirements

- Readability maintained regardless of length
- Real stories opening each chapter
- Age-specific breakdowns (kids/preteens/teens/adults)
- "What comes next" transitions building anticipation
- Tracker tables with current compliance status
- Get the Full Kit CTAs

---

## Word Count Targets

**Target range: 10,000-12,000 words per chapter**

This provides:
- Comprehensive coverage
- Multiple concrete examples
- Sufficient data anchoring
- Practical alternatives
- Depth matching national-level scrutiny

Chapters 5-6 are shorter (6,000-6,500 words) but cover their topics comprehensively. Can be expanded if needed.
