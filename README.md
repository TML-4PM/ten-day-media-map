# The Ten Day Media Map

## What Australian Families Need to Know Before the Ban Lands

A comprehensive 10-chapter series examining social media platforms and their impact on children, teens, and families. Created by Troy Latter, Founder & CEO of Tech 4 Humanity.

## Project Overview

The Ten Day Media Map is not a scare campaign. It's a clarity project positioned to provide Australian families with actionable guidance during the country's social media regulatory changes.

This series breaks down digital platforms by **psychological impact** rather than brand names:

1. **Vanishing Chat** - Secrecy and urgency mechanics
2. **Image Feeds** - Comparison and self-worth erosion  
3. **Short Video** - Attention hijacking and time loss
4. **Game Worlds** - Stranger danger in familiar spaces
5. **Private Servers** - Community belonging vs. radicalization
6. **Group Chats** - The school yard that never closes
7. **Watch Platforms** - Belief formation through algorithmic curation
8. **Location Tracking** - Safety tools as surveillance mechanisms
9. **Realness Apps** - Authenticity performance
10. **Culture Fight Platforms** - Outrage economics

## Current Status

**Completed Chapters:** 5 of 10 (Chapters 3-7)

**Enhanced with:**
- Core lie exposure (the fundamental deception each platform relies on)
- International comparison (how other countries regulate, what's possible)
- Concrete data anchors (specific studies, statistics, documented cases)
- Parent self-audit (questions revealing visibility gaps)
- Technical depth and alternatives (actionable interventions)

**Word counts:**
- Chapter 3: 11,500 words
- Chapter 4: 11,800 words  
- Chapter 5: 6,517 words
- Chapter 6: 6,302 words
- Chapter 7: 10,687 words

## Quality Framework

Each chapter includes:

### 1. Core Lie Exposure
The fundamental deception the platform relies on:
- Chapter 3: "You're not watching content, you're being studied"
- Chapter 4: "The person behind the avatar is unknowable"
- Chapter 5: "Private means controlled, not safe"
- Chapter 6: "The chat is private" (but everything is screenshottable)
- Chapter 7: "The algorithm shows what keeps you watching, not what is true"

### 2. International Comparison
How other countries handle regulation and what could be done:
- China's Douyin restrictions (40-min daily limits, mandatory youth mode)
- South Korea's identity verification and curfew systems
- EU Digital Services Act requirements
- What platforms could do but refuse to implement

### 3. Concrete Data Anchors
Real studies, specific statistics, named sources:
- Stanford Internet Observatory 2024 findings
- FBI exploitation statistics
- Pew Research Center teen behavior data
- Academic studies from Harvard, MIT, Oxford, UC Berkeley
- Platform-specific leaked documents and legal settlements

### 4. Parent Self-Audit
Uncomfortable questions revealing visibility gaps:
- Do you know what your child actually watches?
- Have you used the platforms yourself?
- Can your child explain where opinions come from?
- Would they tell you if something went wrong?

### 5. Technical Depth & Alternatives
How platforms work and what actually helps:
- Algorithm mechanics explained
- Platform architecture analysis  
- Three-tier intervention strategies (Start Here / Next Level / Nuclear Option)
- Ranked alternatives with specific recommendations
- Device-level controls with exact settings

## Editorial Standards

### Voice & Tone
- Clear, direct, human - no jargon
- Write like talking to a smart friend worried about their kid
- Respect intelligence and time
- Give something useful
- No panic, no lecturing

### Evidence Standards
- Every claim needs a source
- Name the study, institution, year
- Provide specific numbers, not vague "studies show"
- Cite leaked documents, legal cases, documented scandals
- International data for comparison

### Balance Requirements
- Acknowledge legitimate use cases
- Present platform benefits alongside harms
- Include "when it works" sections
- Avoid blanket condemnation
- Credit makes criticism more credible

---

## Strategic Positioning

### Timing
Positioned around Australia's upcoming social media ban for minors. National coverage opportunity. Platform compliance tracker establishes factual baseline for accountability.

### Differentiation
- **Not** "10 evil apps"
- **IS** "10 stress types" - psychological pressure patterns
- Defensible positioning above platform wars
- Focuses on human behavior patterns, not brand names
- Designed for national-level scrutiny

### Audience
- Primary: Parents of children 6-17
- Secondary: Educators, policymakers, international observers
- Tertiary: Teens seeking to understand their own experiences
